    "## Anaconda, Jupyter, and Python\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Jupyter and Python for class. Python is a programing language, Jupyter is a shell for intereacting with it and creating nice files, and Anaconda is a distribution that will install both systems for you and manage most of the packages we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some details:\n",
    "- [You will need to download and install Anaconda from this website](https://www.anaconda.com/)\n",
    "- You will then need to go into the package manager under *Environments* and install pandas, seaborn, and scikitlearn. If your Jupyter is updated during class you will need to install these pakcages again.\n",

    "## Github\n",
    "\n",
    "[All of the course materials, including the syllabus, will be in the Github repository for our class, available here](https://github.com/virgilpierce/STAT_411). This is a public repository. There are three ways to use it to get the course files. You can download individual files and folders from it, or you can create a Github account and clone it yourself, and finally you could create a Github account and make a pull request for it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Later in class we will cover how to use Github with your team for versioning control.\n",

    "The course will use a lot of Python, however I am not assuming you already know it. We will have example files to start from, and it is generally a speaking an easy yet powerful language to learn."

    "- Python is highly used in Mathematics, Statistics and Science. It is generally more broadly applicable than R,\n",
