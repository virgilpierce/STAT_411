    "\n",
    "This course is an introduction to the elements of *Data Science*. Topics include\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Visualization\n",
    "- Data Wrangling\n",
    "- Statistical Learning and Predictive Analytics\n",
    "- Text Mining and Spatial Data\n",

    "### Programing\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a somewhat energetic debate among the Data Science community about whether the subject should be taught using Python, R, or some other language. I have made the decision to teach it using Python for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is widely adopted across a large portion of the sciences,\n",
    "- Python is used extensively in industry for both Data Science and for other computations,\n",
    "- As measured by Google Searches, Python is an order of magnitude more used than R,\n",
    "- Python has an extensive collection of libraries for heavy machine learning and is the language used for interacting with cloud computing services like Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services and other heavy iron,\n",
    "- Python is much closer to having parallel programing for Data Science ready,\n",
    "- It is my assertion that after learning Data Science with Python, you will be able to quickly learn how to handle data in R (until you reach the limit of available packages).\n",
    "\n",
    "However. As I said, there is still a debate about this. I am ultimately making the decision because my training in and use of Data Science has been more extensive with Python. In fact, Python is quickly replacing Spreadsheets, Matlab, and to some extent Mathematica in my daily work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**While we will be using Python, no prior knowledge of Python or programing is needed for the class. We will use examples to get started in all cases. The class will serve as a gentle introduction to Python and programing.** \n",
    "\n",
    "That said, if you already know Python, you should use the class to expand your skill set. Remember the core principals of Python:"

[Both of these are in the Github repository for our class available at this link](https://github.com/virgilpierce/STAT_411). I have made it a public repository so it should be easy to find. You have two choices for using this link, you can download individual files from the repository, or you can set up your Github account and then download or clone the repository to your own computer to then open the files in Jupyter. I will accept, and be greatful for, commits back to this repository if you find typos or other things that need to be change. You can also use the \"Issues\" tab in the Github website to let me know about problems you have seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 2:** You will need to be sharing files with your team and also controlling the versions you are working on. Github is used by many companies for controlling the versioning of their files, and that is how we will use it. This is a great skill to be able to talk to employers about that not everyone they interview will have. You should create a Github account. We will cover in class how your team will set up your project and the workflow you should follow.\n",

    "## Connections with Industrial Mathematics\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is directly connected with the growing mathematics field of Data Science. There are many opportunities for people with an expertise in this field. However the field is very accessible so you have competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some thoughts on how to rise to the top:\n",
    "1. Have some projects you have done that you can talk about (we will do this),\n",
    "2. Be able to talk about working with a team i.e. how do you help your team be effective, how did you get your team over a challenge, how do you lead? (we will do this),\n",
    "3. Be able to talk about challenges in the field (we will do this),\n",
    "4. Have a breadth of experience in science or business generally, and mathematics, statistics, and computer science specifically (we will do this), and\n",
    "5. The more you have done the better - I suggest devoting some of your play time to working with data (we will explore Kaggle in this class, and my suggestion is that it become one of your hobbies).\n",
    "\n",
    "I have some literature on building a career in Data Science available if you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Spring there will be a special section of MATH 437 that will even more check off items 1 - 4 here by spending the entire class looking at a problem from industry. I suggest that anyone interested in entering Data Science plan on taking it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Team\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have gathered by a now, a large portion of the coursework will be done by you and your team. We will have 11 classes specifically dedicated to you and your team working on a problem. You will probably need to find time outside of class to work either together or at least on parts of your common problem and the activities for class. Being a good team member is a skill, as much of a skill as programing, and like any skill it takes practice to do well.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the *Team Days* you team has some formal responsibilities:  \n",
    "1. You will designate someone as the leader for that day. It must rotate, and cannot always be the same person. The leader's job is to keep the team on task and make sure the goals for that day are met and the assignments for the next meeting are clear, and\n",
    "2. Each *Team Day* will end with a presentation by the team about what they have done and what they will be doing next. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some thoughts on working effectively with a team, and especially being a leader of your team: *Extreme Ownership* take responsibility for your team at all levels. If something about the team is not working, own it - it is now yours to fix. If I can convince you in this class to learn one thing to take away with you, this is the one I would choose.\n"

    "## Assessments\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Science is extremely accessible. You can do the work in this class with very little background preparation. However if you are not doing the work in this class, none of what we learn will stick with you. There are also many possible things that can happen in a data science analysis and seeing all of them requires that everyone in the class is working with us.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be some homework assignments asking you to explore topics from class, and expand on some of the work we do. These are intended to be done with a partner or two - I do not suggest more than four people working together. If you have done them you will be able to actively participate in our next class. If you have not done them, you will find our next class overwhelming. There will roughly be one or two homework assignments per week, and I would budget 3 - 4 hours per week for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are intended to be done with others, however I understand you are busy, and ultimately if you need to do the homework alone, that will be fine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that you do not necessarily need to have a perfect solution - for one thing there rarely is a perfect solution for this class, but rather you have spent some time thinking about how to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Team Activity\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of our class time will be spent working on big and small activities with your team. Teamwork is part of Data Science, and it is also a really great way to learn. The small activities I am calling *Team Activities*. They are designed to be completed during class, and then your team will just clean them up a little before submitting them online to me after class. While they are team activities, you are ultimately responsible for what your team submits. There will be one a week. I would budget 3 hours per week for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Team Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The major component of the class will be a data science project from your team. This will be a semester long activity with various written reports and presentations from your team. Your team will select the data and question you wish to address. Your first assignment as part of the project will be to write a short 1 - 3 page proposal of what dataset and question you wish to look at. Keep in mind that this is going to be a semester long activity. This proposal will be due after we have been introduced to various types of data and data science questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hesitate to tell you how much time to budget. If all goes as planned, the Team Project will take over your life in November and December *J.K. start practicing a good work-life balance now - plan some time each week you are not doing school work. That said, also it is time to start practicing good work habits - doing things early is far more valuable than doing them at the last minute. I have never been happy with my work done while rushing. I show everyone the work I did months before it was due.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forming your Team\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do this as part of class, however note that a good team should have a set of complimentary expertise. It is helpful if one member of the team has experience with Python, one with Statistics, one with Mathematics (Linear Algebra), and then some interests in other fields from which the dataset might come. A team that is entirely programmers will be missing out on the needed breadth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Packages and Writing Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a common question with this class: Do we need to write code to implement this algorithm or method? The answers to this question depend:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For the *Team Project* you may use any Python module - most of what we do will be in Scikitlearn.\n",
    "2. At some point during class your team will need to write a code implementing one of our methods. This will be one of the subassignments for the project.\n",
    "3. You will need to write some of your own error checking methods to evaluate methods as part of the project - particularly if the standard error estimate is not the best for your problem.\n",
    "4. The Team Activities will involve more specific algorithm implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficulty for you, as a Data Scientists is:  \n",
    "- All of the methods we will use are basically already coded as part of scikitlearn, unless you want to build your own Ensemble or other more involved model,\n",
    "- However, if you do not understand what a method is doing you will not be aware of some of the ways it can fail or lead you to false conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This last point can be mitigated by understanding the Data Science *Process* and following the procedures to get accurate estimates on the error of your model. I.e. it is not necessary to always understand exactly what a model is doing (for example, we generally do not really know why Neural Networks work other than a heuristic for why they should work) - however if we have been true to the error estimating process we should be able to quantify how well the model did.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said. Sometimes we will be wrong. The more critical a model is to our company, the more important it is that we control the process and account for possible errors. I.e. \n",
    "\n",
    "- When I'm goofing off on Kaggle learning new methods, I sequester just one subset of the data,\n",
    "- If we were developing a model the city would use to determine which water lines need maintenance we would need to be sure we understand the chance of false negatives from our model and have multiple levels of sequestered data, and\n",
    "- If we were developing a model the state would use to decide which inmates up for parole were likely to reoffend we would absolutely want to know the errors our model had, isolated multiple levels of data in the building process would be essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Presentations\n",
    "\n",
    "You will give presentations to the class about the work we are doing. Either the team activities, your team project, or the homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "Your grade in the class will be based on homework, team activities, the team project, and class presentations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weighted distribution of assessments towards your final grade will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Homework: 10%\n",
    "- Team Activities: 10%\n",
    "- Team Project: 70%\n",
    "- Class Presentations: 10%\n",
    "\n",
    "The Team Project will be assessed throughout the semester and will include the many small assignments that will eventually add up to the whole project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Grades will be based on a percentage of this weighted total. The distribution will be no tougher than A 90 - 100%, B 80 - 89%, C 70 - 79%, D 60 - 69%, and F 1 - 59%.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading and Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be providing you feedback on the Homework, Team Activities, Class Presentations, and during the semester the Team Project's sub-assignments. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the semester the Team Projects will be assessed by me, and by the class. The final grade on them will be computed by a weighted combination of all scores. \n"
