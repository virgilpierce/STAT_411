    "# Ridge and Lasso Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we are going to explore two more Linear Regression methods. Next class we will explore additional classification methods: *Linear Discriminant Analysis*, *Support Vector Machines*\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth pausing though and pointing out that we will not have time in this class to go over every method. It is worth reading through the documentation on the scikitlearn help page to see the complete lists of methods for which we have algorithms. The documentation includes a discussion of the mathematical underpinnings of the methods as well as some advice on what problems or types of issues they are meant to work best on.\n",

    "To review: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of Linear Regression**: \n",
    "* Fast model to train, \n",
    "* founded on mathematical principles from basic courses (*Linear Algebra and Calculus*), \n",
    "* easy model to interpret (the coeffecients tell us the precise effect of the features)\n",
    "* Rigid model (less chance of overfitting)\n",
    "* Adding additional features improves the $R^2$ for the training data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages of Linear Regression**:\n",
    "* Assumes linear relationships (can be mitigated in some cases by transforming features to new features)\n",
    "* Requires lots of features if they are categorical\n",
    "* Rigid model (will not respond to nonlinearity)\n",
    "* Adding additional features may not improve the $R^2$ for the testing data\n",
    "\n",
    "**A new disadvantage**:\n",
    "* Interpretation becomes hard if the number of features used is very large. \n",
    "* Adding additional features makes the model found more complicated\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning the algorithm finds the best linear model for the result from the predictors which will mean that it has a tendency to use all of the features and assign a non-zero coefficient to them. This is problematic because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It makes interpretation difficult because the model developed incorporates every feature;\n",
    "2. It also makes the model dependent on less important features and might therefore introduce overfitting depending on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall the principal is that given two linear models for our data with comparable errors on the testing data, we would prefer the one that has more coefficients that are zero or near zero. There is nothing in our Linear Regression method that encourages coefficients to not get too large.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will develop two new models below, based on the principle of linear regression, but with an adjustment that will result in encouraging them to find models with small or zero coefficients. We will see that both models outperform *Linear Regression* at least in the test case and provided we choose the parameters carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that last sentence is the real description of what we are doing, we are introducing a parameter to the model that will give us some tuning or adjustment we can make to encourage the model to perform better, similar to the $k$ in $k$-*Nearest Neighbors*. Note that *Linear Regression* had no such thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## House Pricing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between *Linear Regression* and *Ridge or LASSO Regression* becomes apparent when the number of features is large. Hence we will work with the House Pricing Data we have seen before, and we need to do some preliminary work to convert a number of categorical features into numerical ones. I stopped before I was completely done but you can get the idea."

    "### Lasso Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "So *Ridge Regression* did some of what we wanted. It produced a Linear Model that had overall smaller coefficients, and in the process that model while it did worse on the training data (which it had to, remember that *Linear Regression* chooses the model that will do the best out of any linear function at predicting the training data) it performed better on the testing data (though keeping in mind we really should test that statement more carefully). \n",
    "\n",
    "However it still (in most cases I've run) produced a model with quite a few coefficients that were non-zero. We would prefer models where as many coefficients are zero while still performing well because we expect it will produce a model that is easier to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me pause here and look more at that question of interpretation. Why would we prefer models that are easier to interpret?  Well for one thing the simpler our model, the fewer features we need to explain. One example I have worked on that reminds me why this is important is in studying the student success in our entry level mathematics courses. While it is interesting to develop models that use all of the testing, grades, and demographic data I have on our students in these courses; the university ultimately cannot use more than a few very simple features (a couple of test scores and maybe the students high school GPA) to decide how to place them in their mathematics classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea with *Lasso Regression* is to introduce a new objective function that will include a different penalty that responds faster to small values of the coefficients, thus encouraging them to go to zero. \n",
    "We will choose a model that is not differentiable in the $m_j$ coefficients, and thus it will need to use a different solution method than our Calculus 1 approach to *Linear and Ridge Regression*. Define the new objective function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E_{\\alpha}(m, b) = \\frac{1}{2n} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 + \\alpha \\sum_{j=0}^{p-1} | m_j | $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that because we are dividing the first term by the number of samples this also puts more pressure on the penalty term. This objective function cannot be minimized by solving it exactly using Calculus 1 techniques. Instead what the algorithm does is search for a solution by choosing values of $m_j$ and $b$ that improve on the current value, a form of gradient descent. This is therefore our first example of a model that does not give an exact result from a given training set."
