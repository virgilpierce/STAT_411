    "# Wrangling the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Real world data has problems. The most obvious, that we have seen multiple times so far is the presence of missing or incomplete data. Invalid or innaccurate data is a somewhat less common and much harder to detect problem (as we have discussed before we need to approach rejecting data with great caution). \n",
    "\n",
    "We will take this class to discuss a broad approach to data and cover some common problems that come up for various types of data. We will end with an introduction to dealing with strings and images, two types of data that Python provides powerful tools for working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formatting the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting aside the issue of Big Data (data that is so large that it cannot be loaded into a pandas.DataFrame all at once), the main goal in formatting the data is to set it up so that it can be represented by a pandas.DataFrame structure. Most of the examples we have seen in class have been delivered as CSV files that are ready to be read into a dataframe. The primary exceptions so far have been the Berlin Airbnb data that arrived as multiple cross referenced CSV files, and the image recognition example whose data was a collection of JPG files.\n",
